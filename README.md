--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allows you to use [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway), a tiling window manager, with GNOME 3 Session
infrastructure on Linux distributions which have GNOME >= 3.34.

## Work in progress

This repository is currently work-in-progress. Right now, the Sway session is
started by GDM, modelled after sway's [systemd integration wiki page](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/Systemd-integration).

Some further unit files are included to launch as many GNOME deamons in the background as possible in a non-gnome-shell wayland session.
Not all daemons are enabled and further work is necessary for full-compatibility!

## What this enables

 * Keybindings for controlling brightness, Play/Pause, Next/Previous Track, Mute, Volume Up/Down. You can customize [sway/config.d/gnome](./sway/config.d/gnome) after installation
 * Desktop integration for Flatpak and Snap
 * Idle management  / Screen Lock
 * Automatic screen adjustment at sunrise / sunset
 * Privilege management
 * Keyring integration
 * Dynamic display configuration
 * Accessibility Settings
 * Color Management Settings
 * Date & Time Settings
 * Keyboard Settings
 * Power Management Settings
 * Printer Notifications
 * Enabling and Disabling Wireless Devidces (rfkill)
 * Screensaver Settings
 * Handle Sharing music, pictures and videos on the local network
 * Remote Login settings
 * Smartcard handling
 * Sound settings
 * Wacom tablet handling
 * WWAN handling for modems / SIM Cards
 * Display Server settings


## Usage

You may install the system files via `sudo make install` and then copy the
contents of `systemd/user` to `$HOME/.config/systemd/user` and adjust them for
your personal needs.

In your login manager `Sway (systemd)` should be startable as a new session.

## Dependencies

You need to manually install these dependencies first:

 * brightnessctl - support keybindings for screen brightness control
 * network-manager-gnome - Network Manager control applet
 * pulseaudio-utils - support keybindings for volume control
 * playerctl - support binding media keys
 * xdg-desktop-portal - desktop integration for Flatpak and Snap
 * swayidle - for idle management
 * swaylock - for screen lock
 * redshift - for automatic screen dimming
 * policykit-1-gnome - privilege management
 * mako - lightweight Wayland
 * [kanshi](https://github.com/emersion/kanshi) - Dynamic display configuration for Wayland
 * gnome-keyring - manage SSH keys, PKCS11 and other secrets
 * gnome-session-bin - the gnome session binary itself
 * gnome-settings-daemon-common - provides GNOME settings services.

## Installation

While this project can be installed with a simple `sudo make install` after fetching the Git repo,
more effort may be required to install the dependencies, especially if they aren't packaged for your
Linux distribution. Distro-specific extensions are maintained on the wiki.
